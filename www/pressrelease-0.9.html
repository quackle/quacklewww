<p>6 March 2006 - THE INTERNET - Jason Katz-Brown and John O'Laughlin are excited to announce today the public release of Quackle (<a href="http://www.quackle.org/">www.quackle.org</a>), a crossword game artificial intelligence and analysis tool that rivals the best players in the world. It can be configured to play with different board configurations and use the newest lexicons. Quackle includes a move generator, move evaluator, simulator, and <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html">Qt</a>-based user interface and can be used with any board layout, alphabet, lexicon, and tile distribution. It is licensed under the open-source revised BSD license.</p>

<p>To further our knowledge of the mathematics and strategy behind crossword games, we need versatile tools for replaying games and analyzing positions. Quackle provides powerful tools in an easy-to-use interface no crossword game program has ever matched. Quackle simulations can be run for any number of plies and report on the average turn scores and standard deviation for each ply separately. Sims can also be paused and adjusted on the fly. "Using Quackle's flexible postmortem analysis and fine-grained simulation capabilities will make everyone a stronger crossword game player, and change the way you evaluate positions over the board," says coauthor Jason Katz-Brown.</p>

<p>The ability to adapt to any lexicon and board layout makes Quackle a truly global tool. An Italian-language lexicon is included in this beta release as a proof of concept. Users can also switch between SOWPODS, TWL06, and TWL98 lexicons at any time.</p>
